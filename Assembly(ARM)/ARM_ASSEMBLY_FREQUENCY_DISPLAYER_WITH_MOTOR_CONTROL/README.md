This system sampled 2000 data from the microphone with ADC and found the dominant frequency by taking Fourier Transform. The found dominant frequency and amplitude in Decibel are displayed continuously on an LCD screen. The system also had a keypad to enter threshold values for frequency and Amplitude. The system used both the LCD screen and LEDs to indicate whether the frequency and amplitude are higher or lower than the threshold values. The system also had a step motor to indicate the frequency. The higher the frequency the faster the motor spin.
